Component Extraction (CExtr): Identifying a concept's essential elements. For \"Learning\", this could involve extracting components like \"information acquisition\", \"skill development\", \"retention\" and \"transfer\". Each component is then broken down into subcomponents and assigned a CID. \n\n3. Contextual Structure (CtxtSt): Clarifying interrelations between components. For example, how \"information acquisition\" relates to \"skill development\". This step maps out the overall conceptual framework.\n\n4. Hierarchical Adaptation (HAdpt): Organizing concepts into hierarchies based on abstraction levels. For instance, the general concept of \"Learning\" at the top level, main components like \"information acquisition\" at the next level, and specific subcomponents under each component at subsequent levels. This makes complex ideas easier to understand systematically.\n\n5. Cross-Referential Integration (XRefInt): Connecting related concepts through cross-referencing. For example, linking \"Learning\" and \"Memory\" at a high level.  \n\nTo apply the SPR method, first identify the complex concept you want to simplify. Then extract its main components and subdivide them into subcomponents. Assign each a CID. Next, determine contexts and interrelations between these parts. Organize them hierarchically from broad to specific. Finally, cross-reference related concepts. The SPR technique can be used to represent diverse complex ideas ranging from processes and theories to systems and subjects.

Scientists estimate there are over 100 million pieces of space trash orbiting Earth, from particles smaller than 1 mm to entire spent rocket stages and defunct satellites.  \n\nThe greatest concern with space trash is the damage it can inflict on functioning spacecraft and satellites. Even small pieces of trash can damage or disable critical components like solar panels or navigational systems. Space trash also poses risks to astronauts during spacewalks or extravehicular activities.   \n\nSeveral measures have been proposed to address the space trash problem, including better monitoring and tracking of objects, improved spacecraft and satellite design, and active debris removal using nets, lasers, or spacecraft to physically retrieve larger pieces of space trash.

Hierarchical Adaptation (HAdpt): Organizing concepts into hierarchies based on abstraction levels. For instance, the general concept of \"Learning\" at the top level, main components like \"information acquisition\" at the next level, and specific subcomponents under each component at subsequent levels. This makes complex ideas easier to understand systematically. \n\n5. Cross-Referential Integration (XRefInt): Connecting related concepts through cross-referencing.
